        <p>I was born November 15, 1986 in the city of Detroit, MI and was raised on the West 7mile area of the city.
          While growing up my favorite things to do was to play basketball, skate, play video games, and hang out with
          my friends. Being from an area where it was easy to get in to trouble, I was never the kind to get in to
          anything that might land me in jail or disappoint my family. As I grew up, I started to develop an interest for
          technology. Not knowing where to start, I took it upon myself to do research and find out the many cool things
          you can do in this industry. As time went on my interest became a passion, and this passion lead me to graduating
          college with a degree in Information Technology. After graduating, I decided to further my education and skills
          at a coding bootcamp called Grand Circus. I'm glad that I've made the decision to go to this school, because I
          that Grand Circus will do whatever they can to get me to the next level in my career in tech.
